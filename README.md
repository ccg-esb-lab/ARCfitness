# ARC Stability Landscape — Computational Model

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks implementing and analyzing a stochastic, resource-explicit model of bacterial competition between a reference strain and a library of ARC-bearing competitors.  
The workflow reproduces the full computational pipeline described in the Supplementary Information, from parameter calibration to large-scale stability simulations and downstream analysis.

## Notebook Structure

### 1. `MonodGillespieARC_1parametrizationStrain.ipynb`
Fits growth parameters for individual experimental strains under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.  
The estimated parameters \((V_i, K_i, c_i)\) are used as inputs for downstream ARC calibration and simulations.

### 2. `MonodGillespieARC_2_synthetic_library.ipynb`
Constructs the ARC fitness landscape used in the simulations.  
This notebook:
- estimates family-level fitness distributions from experimental competition data,
- calibrates experimental ARC strains to match measured fitness values,
- generates synthetic ARC strains to complete family-specific fitness libraries.

Both experimental and synthetic ARC libraries are exported as calibrated fitness tables.

### 3. `MonodGillespieMI_2_stability.ipynb`
Describes and illustrates the stochastic Monod–Gillespie model.  
This notebook introduces the resource-explicit formulation, growth–dilution cycles, and validation simulations.

### 4. `MonodGillespieARC_4_stability_expe.ipynb`
Runs in silico competition experiments between the reference strain and ARC libraries.  
Simulations are performed under constant aerobiosis, constant anaerobiosis, or single-switch oxygen schedules parameterized by the switch time \(K\).  
Outputs include time-resolved abundances, final frequencies, and persistence outcomes.

### 5. `MonodGillespieARC_5_stability_analysis.ipynb`
Aggregates simulation outputs and computes population-level statistics, including persistence and rescue probabilities.  
This notebook generates the figures and summary metrics reported in the main text and Supplementary Information.

## Data Directory

The `data/` directory contains intermediate and final datasets generated by the notebooks:

- **Fitted growth parameters for experimental strains**  
  Generated by `MonodGillespieARC_2_synthetic_library.ipynb`.

- **Calibrated ARC fitness libraries (experimental + synthetic)**  
  Generated by `MonodGillespieARC_2_synthetic_library.ipynb`.  
  These tables define the ARC populations used in all stability simulations.

- **Pair-level and aggregated stability simulation results**  
  Generated by `MonodGillespieARC_4_stability_expe.ipynb`.  
  These include replicate-level outcomes and summary persistence metrics.

All files can be regenerated by running the notebooks in order.
